## Pro: Find the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) (Dynamic Programming)
### Problem:
Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

#### Example:
Input: [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60]  
Output: 5  
(Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [10, 22, 33, 50, 60])
