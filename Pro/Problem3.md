## Pro: Prime factor finder

## Problem
Write a program that will get the prime factors of 2 number inputs from user and get their greatest common divisor. Do this in iterative and recursive approach.

##### Example
Enter the first number: 12  
Enter the second number: 24  
Prime factors of 12 : [2, 2, 3]  
Prime factors of 24 : [2, 2, 2, 2, 3]  
Greatest common divisor: 12
